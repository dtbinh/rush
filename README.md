The "rush" game engine
======================

...or, rather, the source code to a simple 2D/3D game framework written long time ago and scrapped together recently, so that internets have it.
 
Was used to make the freeware game called ["HoneyRush"](http://blog.ruslans.com/2009/12/bees-in-space-or-story-of-my-first.html), and as a base to several indie educational children games, e.g. [Little Red Riding Hood](http://www.ndgames.ru/games/little_red_riding_hood).

Has many stubs with unfinished stuff, and at the moment possibly does not even compile.
